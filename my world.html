        <h1 align="center"> DORIS' twenty-seven degrees of space </h1>

        <h2>I. About my name</h2>
            <h3>· My real name is--</h3>
                <p> <em>Doris.</em> You can call me this anytime you see me.And I like this name quite much. I think it could represent me somehow.</p>
            <h3>· I also have another name--</h3>
                <p> <em>Fahrenheitxxvii.</em> </p>
                <p>You might notice this word beside the web icon. Well, this is the name that I gave it to myself.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you the story behind it.</p>
                    <p>The inspiration of the name is from one of the songs by my favorite singer,<stong>Louis Tomlinson</stong>. </p>
                    <img src="https://cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/louis-rock/louis-tomlinson-rocks-out-01.jpg">
                    <p>this is him, lately on world tour.</p>
                    <p>The song's name is:<em>"Don't let it break your heart".</em> In the first lyric, he wrote:<em> "On our way to twenty seven,got a place on the other side of London, doing better,doing better."</em> </p>
                    <iframe width="550" height="317" src="<iframe width="731" height="411" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aY30nSWhX9g" title="Louis Tomlinson - Don&#39;t Let It Break Your Heart (Official Lyric Video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>" <p>this is the lyric vedio of this song.</p>
                    <p>This song helped me going through a tough time. After that time, I was looking for a new name that could represent me.As Louis played a big part of helping me, I chose "Twenty Senven" from the lyric and wrote it in roman numerals in my name. </p>
                    <P>The "Fahrenheit" part, is simply because Louis is from England, and in England, they use fahrenheit.</P>
                    <p>So, you're <strong> not going to find </strong> twenty seven aspects about me in this web, but if we have chances, I have <mark>way more than</mark> twenty seven things to tell you about me.</p>
        
        <h2>II.What do I study now?</h2>
            <h3><em> <strong><mark>Film!</mark></strong></em> </h3>
            <p>I was intrested in film since I was 10 years old. And the first time I get to know editing is when I was 11.</p>
            <p>I continuely wrote stories for the past 7 years. And I have been taken photos for landscapes and people for 8 years.</p>
            <p>And I listen to musics all the time.</p>
            <p>So basicly, I get in touch with most of the elements of film before university.</p>
            <p>So, you may not be surprised to know I joined in my school's film festival when I was in highschool, and I was the:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scripwriter</li>
                <li>Ceminatographer</li>
                <li>Editor</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It seems quite corresponding to my experiences, right?</p>
            <p>Although this film did not get any awards, but this experience is one of the main reasons that I decided to study film in university.</p>
            <p>I thought film is the right lauguage to express myself. At least I hope.</p>

        <h2>III.My middle school life </h2>
            <p>I am from Beijing, spent my 6 year of middle school life in RDFZ.</p>
            <p>I was quite happy when I was in junior high, mainly because I was naive and top graded. I do not feel the competition or much unkind feelings. </p>
            <p>But things are totally different in senior high. I do not like the circumstances, all I was thinking about is leaving school and never went back.</p>
            <p>One of the reasons is because I don't think GaoKao is the right way to messure my ability. But GaoKao could decided which school I will get into.</p>
            <p>But after all, I'm now in HK, and I am really happy that I could live the life I like.</p>

        <h2>IV.Music</h2>
            <p>Music is a big part of me, so,</p>
            <h3>·First,<stong>artists I like</stong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>One Direction</li>
                <p>I think maybe it is one of the most widely known boy band around 2010s. You must once listened their "What makes you beautiful".</p>
                <iframe width="300" height="190" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJO3ROT-A4E" title="One Direction - What Makes You Beautiful (Official Video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
                <p>If you have not listened to this song before, you should take a look at this vedio maybe bring back some memories. </p>
                <p>They are the first artist that I listened to, somebody palyed this song in the classroom when I was doing the cleaning. And I searched this song when I got home, then my music journey began.</p>

                <li>Louis Tomlinson</li>
                <p>I have mentioned this guy previousely, he is actually from One Direction. But I fell in love of his song three years after I met One direction.</p>
                <p>My favorite songs of his are <em>Saturday</em> and <em>Chicago</em> from his new album. I made a music vedio of <em>Saturday</em> last year in one of my major class. And it got quite a good mark.</p>
                <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0MTp0hyAPs></a> <p>This is the audio of Saturday.</p>

                <li>Inhaler</li>
                <p>This is an Irish indie rock band that I met recently, and I absolutely love them.</p>
                <p>The first time that I know their name is from Louis, he recommended this band in the year 2020. </p>
                <p>I listened to some of their songs by then, but I was going through a severe mental break down, and I forget that I have actually listened to their songs until a month ago.</p>
                <p>And I fell in love with their songs another three years after I met Louis' song.</p>

                <p>This is one of my favorite live show of them, the guitar riffs are beautiful I <mark> <stong>LOVE</stong></mark> how they devoted themselves on the stage without their headphones.</p>

                <li>The 1975</li>
                <p>Really talented band from Manchester, their Song "About you" and "fallingforyou" are my favorite,</p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zEbadMOGrk&list=PLLiGLLel421FyPF3ZnyCEUnLBALPGqgrp&index=31"></a> <p>This is one of their live shows singing <em>fallingforyou</em></p>
